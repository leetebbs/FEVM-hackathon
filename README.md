# Filecoin / EthOnline FEVM Hackathon 

This project allows users to mint multiple copies of their NFTS on the Wallaby testnet of FEVM using ERC1155 starndards contract.

Web3Storage is used to store media and metadata.

Ethers.js is used to interact with the contract on FEVM

Using rainbow wallet to connect users.

With help from Mentors in discord I was able to change the openzeppelin ERC1155 contract to work on FEVM
